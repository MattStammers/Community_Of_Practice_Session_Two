This basic introduction folder by Catalina explains how to get set up with a basic python virtual environment

We recommend reading through these before you dive into each section.

To set up a Python venv you call

```bat
python -m venv "{venv_name}"
```

You then open the virtual environment and run activate.bat or activate for linux. 🐱‍🏍

Then call

```bat
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

And dependencies will be installed
