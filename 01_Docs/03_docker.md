## What is Docker?
Docker is an open-source platform designed to make it easier to create, deploy, and run applications by using containers. Containers allow developers to package an application with all its dependencies into a standardised unit, ensuring that it will run consistently across different environments.
It is also a great tool for reproducibility of research work, ensuring that outputs and results can be reproduced by using the same software environment. 

## Key Concepts:

1. Containers: Lightweight, standalone, executable packages that contain everything needed to run a piece of software, including the code, runtime, libraries, and system tools. They provide process and resource isolation, allowing applications to run independently without interference from other processes or environments.
Containers can run on any machine that supports the container runtime, making them highly portable and consistent across different environments.
2. Images: Read-only templates used to create containers. They contain the application code, dependencies, and other configuration required to run the application.
3. Dockerfile: Text document that contains instructions for building a Docker image. It specifies the base image, environment variables, dependencies, and commands needed to configure the image.
4. Docker Engine: Core component of Docker that provides the runtime environment for containers.
5. Docker Hub: Storage resource and associated website where a vast collection of preexisting container images are documented and stored, and are made available for your use. You can also share your images via Docker
