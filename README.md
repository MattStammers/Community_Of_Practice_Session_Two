This takes the models found in eda_explosion from [Python_Training_for_BI_Analysts](https://github.com/MattStammers/Python_Training_For_BI_Analysts) and wraps it into Python classes

## Docker

This code has been wrapped in a docker container and an image of this can be found on [Dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/ejsheldon/dna_tutorial/general)

To run this:
```bash
docker pull ejsheldon/dna_tutorial:0.0.1
docker run --name dna -p 8000:5000 --rm dna_tutorial:0.0.1
```

## Explainer

- We will explain the file structure during the training. It looks complex but this is necessary to keep you from accidentally comitting secrets to git (even internally) üê±‚Äçüèç

- Ordinarily data would not be committed in a repository but it is necessary for this toy app. Normally, you should add your /data directory to the gitignore file so you don't accidentally commit it to the repo. To make sure this is enabled call:

```bat
pre-commit install
```

before using git to commit any work. Then the hooks will protect you from accidentally committing a secret. You can add exceptions such as the lockfile or tests to the yaml file üòé (Yaml is just a heirarhical set of instructions).

- Either the Pipenv or requirements.txt files can be used to set up the python environment
