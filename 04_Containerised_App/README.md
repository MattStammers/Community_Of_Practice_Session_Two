This takes the models found in eda_explosion from [Python_Training_for_BI_Analysts](https://github.com/MattStammers/Python_Training_For_BI_Analysts) and wraps it into Python classes

## Docker

This code has been wrapped in a docker container and an image of this can be found on [Dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/ejsheldon/dna_tutorial/general)

To run this install docker and WSL then run the above or cd to the 04_Containerised_App folder and run:

```sh
docker docker build -t no_shows_improved .
docker docker run -d -p 5000:5000 no_shows_improved
```

Now if you navigate to localhost:5000 in any browser the app should be up in the container.

To kill all the containers and start again

```sh
docker stop $(docker ps -aq)
```

Then run the container again to start it up once more.

## Enjoy! üòÅ
